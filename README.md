# FASTCONVEXCOMB
## Description
<center>
The algorithm is a novel approach for fast computation of convex combination coefficients based on
ray shooting. Such a problem arises in the real-time implementation of many set-based control techniques, which require a
computationally efficient solution to cope with high dimension or fast dynamics systems. The proposed method poses no
constraints on the polytope structure and requires only a list of vertices and boundary hyperplanes. The new method provided faster solutions in all cases, with speed-ups of up to ten-fold.

## Installation

Add the path of the Main folder to the MATLAB Path

### Dependencies

External dependencies of FastConvexComb are:

1. MPT3 ([https://www.mpt3.org/](https://www.mpt3.org/))

## Example

 An usage example of the script is given by [testConvexCombination.m](testConvexCombination.m)
 
 The example adopted a unitary cube to illustrate the algorithm working. 
 The algorithm sequence of ray-shoooting for the point 
 x = [ 0.2000  -0.3000    0.5000] is shown in the following figures

As result, the algorithm returns the vertices and the coefficients of the convex combination
