# FASTCONVEXCOMB
Fast Convex Combination Computation


The algorithm is a novel approach for fast computation of convex combination coefficients based on
ray shooting. Such a problem arises in the real-time implementation of many set-based control techniques, which require a
computationally efficient solution to cope with high dimension or fast dynamics systems. The proposed method poses no
constraints on the polytope structure and requires only a list of vertices and boundary hyperplanes. The new method provided faster solutions in all cases, with speed-ups of up to ten-fold.
